[![Codacy Badge](https://api.codacy.com/project/badge/Grade/2d90aba494c641628368563390b19c17)](https://app.codacy.com/app/DasserBasyouni/PopularMoviesStage1?utm_source=github.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=DasserBasyouni/PopularMoviesStage1&utm_campaign=Badge_Grade_Dashboard)

Most of us can relate to kicking back on the couch and enjoying a movie with friends and family. In this project, this app is built to allow users to discover the most popular movies playing.

## What this app is doing
-   Present the user with a grid arrangement of movie posters upon launch.
-   Allow your user to change sort order via a 3-dots menu popup that offers most popular or by highest-rated sorting modes.
-   Allow the user to tap on a movie poster and transition to a details screen with additional information such as: original title, movie poster image thumbnail, A plot synopsis (called overview in the api), user rating (called vote_average in the api), and release date.

## What I have learnt from the app
-   Fetching data from the Internet with theMovieDB API.
-   Using adapters and custom list layouts to populate list views.
-   Icorporating libraries to simplify the amount of code you need to write
